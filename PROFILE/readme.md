# Data on Kubernetes


DoKC is an openly governed group of curious and experienced practitioners, taking inspiration from the CNCF and Apache Software Foundation. Born in spring 2020 our aim is to assist in the emergence and development of techniques for the use of Kubernetes for data.

# The Rap-god  project

This project is about:
- Using cloud-native data services on Kubernetes
- Using a cloud-native database on Kubernetes for storing data
- Using a cloud-native workflow engine to determine how to handle and move data
- Showing how a simple app or script can be used on Kubernetes as part of a data pipeline
- Showing how to develop custom code components for use in Kubernetes
- Showing which depending services you might encounter and need when wanting to start running data workloads on Kubernetes


### The plan:

We have now decided that we will be following the incremental development model where we start with adding basic features to the project and slowly start adding features on top of it. We have divided the teams into working groups for improving the workflow and ensure progress in the project development.

### What are working groups?

Working groups are a team of few contributors whoâ€™d specifically focus on the specific topic/mandate of the working group. A working group, or working party, is a group of contributors working together to achieve specified goals. The groups are domain-specific and focus on discussion or activity around a specific subject area. The term can sometimes refer to an interdisciplinary collaboration of researchers working on new activities/tasks.
