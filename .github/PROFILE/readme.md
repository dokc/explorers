# Data on Kubernetes Community

[90% believe](https://dok.community/dokc-2021-report/) Kubernetes is ready for stateful workloads, but few patterns or best practices exist for running data workloads on Kubernetes. The [Data on Kubernetes Community (DoKC)](https://dok.community/) facilitates the creation and sharing of techniques to help end users advance in their DoK journey.

DoKC is managed by Constantia.io. If your company wants to help shape the evolution of the DoK landscape, consider joining DoKC as a [sponsor](https://dok.community/join/). For details about who’s involved and how DoKC plays a role, read the [original announcement](https://dok.community/newsroom/data-on-kubernetes-community-unites-to-usher-in-new-era-for-running-data-on-kubernetes/).
