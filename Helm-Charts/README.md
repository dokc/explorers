## What is the custom k8ssandra-lightweight operator ?

This the kubernetes-operator which contains the following packages:\
    1. Apache Cassandra\
    2. Stargate\
    3. Prometheus <br />
    4. Grafana <br />
    This package a lightweight package

## Installation and requirement

### Installation
To install this package, you can add this to your helm repositories by 

- `helm repo add dokc https://dokc.github.io/Helm-Charts/`

Once added, update the repository by running

- `helm repo update`

To check the repositories in your local setup, check if the `dokc` repo is added by running

- `helm repo list`

It must show something like this
```
NAME                    URL
cassandra               https://helm.k8ssandra.io/stable
traefik                 https://helm.traefik.io/traefik
minio                   https://helm.min.io
prometheus-community    https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
```

Once the repository is listed, you can run your k8ssandra cluster, but this would require a YAML file which would like this
_Replace: < > with values_

```yaml
 cassandra:
  version: < Cassandra Version Number, preferred version = 4.0.1 >  
  cassandraLibDirVolume:
    storageClass: default
    size: 5Gi
  allowMultipleNodesPerWorker: true
  heap:
   size: 1G
   newGenSize: 1G
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 2Gi
    limits:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 2Gi
  datacenters:
  - name: < Data Center Name >
    size: < Size >
    racks:
    - name: < Rack Name >
    
kube-prometheus-stack:
  grafana:
    adminUser: < Grafana Admin User >
    adminPassword: < Grafana Password >
    
    
stargate:
  enabled: < Boolean >
  replicas: 1
  heapMB: 256
  cpuReqMillicores: 200
  cpuLimMillicores: 1000
  
```

To run the cluster, execute the following command: helm install -f < filename >.yaml <Instance Name (or) Cluster Name> dokc/k8s-lightweight

** The process should roughly take 4 minutes , wait for the pods to start up **

To check the status of the pods run:

`kubectl get pods`

```
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
